# Companion files for TASLP CGMM PSZ

Companion files for the paper "CGMM-based Sound Zone Generation using Robust Pressure Matching with ATF perturbation constraints " presented in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing. 

The Audio files are generated by the simulations, and the sample frequency is 16KHz. The audio files have been named according to the algorithm used, and the application scenario. 

PM (true) and (ii) PM (measured) correspond to the cases that the PM method is evaluated by the true ATFs and measured ATFs, respectively; (iii) RPM (sphere) and (iv) RPM (ellipsoid) correspond to the case of the proposed robust pressure matching (RPM) method with a sphere constraint and an ellipsoidal constraint, respectively.
